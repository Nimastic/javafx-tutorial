# JavaFX Chatbot Project - Duke GUI

This project is a JavaFX-based chatbot application called Duke. It demonstrates how to build a GUI for a chatbot using JavaFX. The project follows a tutorial format and is split into several stages, from setting up the basic project structure to incorporating a fully functional GUI with FXML.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17**: Ensure that you have JDK 17 installed on your system.
  - You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).
  
- **Gradle**: Gradle is used for managing dependencies and building the project.
  - To install Gradle, refer to [Gradle installation guide](https://gradle.org/install/).

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA, but any Java-supporting IDE should work.
  - For IntelliJ, refer to [IntelliJ IDEA Setup](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and configure it with JDK 17.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Open the Project in Your IDE:
If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, open the project from the main screen. Make sure to import the build.gradle file for Gradle setup.

### Configure JavaFX Dependencies:
Update your build.gradle file to include the following dependencies for JavaFX based on your operating system:

```bash
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
}
```

### Sync Dependencies:
- For IntelliJ IDEA: Use the Gradle tool window to refresh and reload dependencies.
- Without an IDE: Run the following command in the terminal:
```./gradlew clean build```

### Running the Project:
- Run the project using Gradle in the terminal:
```./gradlew run```
- Alternatively, use your IDE's run configuration to run the Launcher class.

### Setting Up FXML (Optional):
You can install Scene Builder to visually design the JavaFX GUI components and bind them to your controller classes.

## Development
The project structure contains:

- Main.java: Entry point for the JavaFX application.
- Launcher.java: Acts as the launcher to avoid classpath issues.
- MainWindow.fxml: FXML file that defines the GUI layout.
- DialogBox.java: Custom control for chat dialog boxes.

## Running the Application
After setting everything up, you should be able to run the application and see the following window:
- A simple GUI with a text input field, a send button, and a scrollable area for displaying the conversation.

## Troubleshooting
Common Issues
JavaFX not loading properly:

Ensure that you're using JDK 17 and the correct JavaFX version. Check the Gradle dependencies and reload them.
Unsupported JavaFX configuration warning:

This warning can be safely ignored if you are using a newer version of JavaFX with an older JDK.
FXML or resource loading issues:

Make sure that the paths in your code (e.g., image paths) are correct and relative to the resources directory.
Platform-Specific Notes
Windows
Ensure JavaFX libraries are properly set with the classifier win in your build.gradle.
macOS
Ensure JavaFX libraries are set with the classifier mac in your build.gradle.
